Hi Humans!

I'm just a stay at home mom using any free time I get to learn! I love computers and have decided to use some excellent free learning resources to learn to code! Hoping to learn enough to be able to re-enter the world of the employed and start building a fun and lucrative career. 

Also, moon tacos.
